# Encrpytion

The Caesar Cypher method of encryption is giving a shift value to any input letter or number and not shifting special characters. 

In this lab I was able to encrypt and decrypt, but I was unable to figure out how to crack the cypher without being provided a key to begin with. 

All tests except for the tests for cracking were passing.
